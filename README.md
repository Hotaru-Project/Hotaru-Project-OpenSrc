# Introduction

   This project's purpose is to digitalize the old-school system that the school have in place such as schedule look up, finding the right classroom and so on
This project is made for students that study in Piboonumpen Demonstration Burapha University, but you can modify this project to suit your needs. But keep in mind that some
of this project's code is hard coded, which means it will be really hard to modify and should be used as a template only.

# How to use
You can visit our website for a full guide at https://hotaruproject.weebly.com

# Host your own bot
You can use our code to host your own bot by putting your bot token in the `main.py` file and host that file however you want.
Optionally, you can grab our cogs and the associated database to be the template for your school database.
